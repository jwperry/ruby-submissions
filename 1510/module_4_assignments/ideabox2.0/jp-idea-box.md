# Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* Yes, base functionality is all complete.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
* I completed the 20 point tagging extension.
* I inadvertently completed most of of the in-line editing extension. I set up in-line edits triggered by clicking on the edit button just because it was a fun challenge, but you have to click 'save' to keep the changes.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

[Using .call to control state](https://github.com/jwperry/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/062285ab59f915e3006e264efb6023197136b6ac/app/assets/javascripts/tag-filter.js#L16-L31)
  * This particular piece of code taught me more about JavaScript than any other. I got stuck for a really long time trying to reference what I wanted through various functions, and this is really what made me understand the use of methods like .call(), .apply(), and .bind().

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

[Constructing HTML manually](https://github.com/jwperry/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/062285ab59f915e3006e264efb6023197136b6ac/app/assets/javascripts/list-ideas.js.erb#L48-L72)
  * I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to construct/insert some HTML, and I'm sure this is NOT it. I have no idea how to refactor it in the context of my program. This version already IS refactored as it was originally one huge, hideous block until I broke it out into several methods.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'
[Sad path test](https://github.com/jwperry/revenge_of_idea_box/blob/062285ab59f915e3006e264efb6023197136b6ac/spec/models/idea_spec.rb#L13-L31)
  * Here is an example of some model edge-case testing, making sure new ideas are created with all the required attributes.
